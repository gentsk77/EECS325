###1. Three types of switching fabric are discussed in Section 4.2. List and briefly describe each type. Which, if any, can send multiple packets across the fabric in parallel?

- **switching via memory**
  - traditional computers with switching under direct control of CPU
  - datagrams are copied to system's memory
  - switching rate is limited by memory bandwidth (2 bus crossings per datagram)
- **switching via a bus**
  - switch datagram from input port memory to output port memory via a shared bus
  - all output ports will receive the datagram, but nly the correct one will keep it
  - switching speed is limited by bus bandwidth
- **switching via interconnection network (crossbar)**
  - switch datagrams via 2N buses that connect N input ports to N output ports
  - each verticle bus intersects with each horizontal bus at an intersection that is controlled by the fabric controller
  - fragment datagram into cells of fixed length and switch these cells through the fabric 
  - datagrams to be forwarded will not be blocked by datagrams being forwarded to the other ports 
  - overcome bus bandwidth limitations 
- only **switching via interconnction network** can send multiple datagrams across the fabric in parallel

###2. What is HOL blocking? Does it occur in input ports or output ports?

HOL (Head of the Line) blocking: queued datagram at front of the queue prevents the following ones in the queue from moving forward. 
HOL occurs in input ports. 

###3. What fields in the IP header can be used to ensure that a packet is forwarded through no more than N routers?

The `time to live` field. It keeps track of the maximum number of remaining hops and decrements the value at each router.  

###4. When a large datagram is fragmented into multiple smaller datagrams, where are these smaller datagrams reassembled into a single larger datagram?

These smaller datagrams are only reassembled into a single larger datagram at their **final destination**, before it is passed to and processed by the transport layer.

###5. Consider the network below:

![p5 image](/Images/p5.png)

####a. Show the forwarding table in router A, such that all traffic destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 3.

| Destination Address | Link Interface |
| ------------------- | :------------: |
| H3                  |       3        |

####b. Can you write down a forwarding table in router A, such that all traffic from H1 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 3, while all traffic from H2 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 4?

No, it's not possible. Since a forwarding table is only determined by the destination address, in this case, it is impossible to defferentiate traffic from H1 to H3 and traffic from H2 to H3. 

###6. Consider a datagram network using 32-bit host addresses. Suppose a router has four links, numbered 0 through 3, and packets are to be forwarded to the link interfaces as follows:

![p6 image](/Images/p6.png)

####a. Provide a forwarding table that has five entries, uses longest prefix matching, and forwards packets to the correct link interfaces.

| Destination Address Range           | Link Interface |
| ----------------------------------- | :------------: |
| 11100000 00****** ******** ******** |       0        |
| 11100000 01000000 ******** ******** |       1        |
| 1110000* ******** ******** ******** |       2        |
| 11100001 1******* ******** ******** |       3        |
| otherwise                           |       3        |

####b. Describe how your forwarding table determines the appropriate link interface for datagrams with destination addresses:

![p6b image](/Images/p6b.png)

1. The longest prefix of `11001000 10010001 01010001 01010101` matches none of the first four prefix entries from the forwarding table above, therefore should be matched to the `otherwise` entry and forwarded to link interface `3`, which confirms with the destination provided by the original forwarding table. 
2. The longest prefix of `11100001 01000000 11000011 00111100` matches the `1110000` prefix entry from the forwarding table above, therefore should be forwarded to link interface 2, which confirms with the destination provided by the original forwarding table. 
3. The longest prefix of `11100001 10000000 00010001 01110111` matches the `11100001 1` prefix entry from the forwarding table above, therefore should be forwarded to link interface 3, which confirms with the destination provided by the original forwarding table. 

###7. Consider a router that interconnects three subnets: Subnet 1, Subnet 2, and Subnet 3. Suppose all of the interfaces in each of these three subnets are required to have the prefix 223.1.17/24. Also suppose that Subnet 1 is required to support at least 60 interfaces, Subnet 2 is required to support at least 90 interfaces, and Subnet 3 is to support at least 12 interfaces. Provide three network addresses (of the form a.b.c.d/x) that satisfy these constraints.

According to the problem, it should be sufficient to provide 64 addresses for Subnet 1, 128 addresses for Subnet 2, and 16 addresses for Subnet 3. Since all of the interfaces in each of these three subnets are required to have the prefix `223.1.17/24`, the addresses should be ranging from `223.1.17.0` to `223.1.17.255`. 

To make our life easier, we shall start with the subnet that requires the most addresses, so as to have addresses with longest prefix accordingly for each subnet. 

- **Subnet 2**: 
  - we need 128 addresses, least significant number of which ranging from 0 to 127
  - the range is satisfied by `223.1.17.0` (`223.1.17.00000000`) to `223.1.17.127` (`223.1.17.01111111`) 
  - the address can be represented as `223.1.17.0/25`
- **Subenet 1**: 
  - we need 64 addresses, least significant number of which ranging from 0 to 63
  - the range is satisfied by `223.1.17.128` (`223.1.17.10000000`) to `223.1.17.191` (`223.1.17.10111111`)
  - the address can be represented as `223.1.17.128/26`
- **Subnet 3**
  - we need 16 addresses, least significant number of which ranging from 0 to 15
  - the range is satisfied by `223.1.17.192` (`223.1.17.11000000`) to `223.1.17.207` (`223.1.17.11001111`)
  - the address can be represented as `223.1.17.192/28`

In conclusion, we have network address `223.1.17.128/26` for Subnet 1, `223.1.17.0/25` for Subnet 2, and `223.1.17.192/28` for Subnet 3. 

###8. Consider sending a 2100-byte datagram into a link that has an MTU of 700 bytes. Suppose the original datagram is stamped with the identification number 422. How many fragments are generated? What are the values in the various fields in the IP datagram(s) generated related to fragmentation?

Since $MTU = 700$ byte, we may conclude that the maximum length of the data field is $700 - 20 = 680$ byte since we have 20 bytes for the IP header. Therefore, a total of $\lceil \frac{2100 - 20}{680} \rceil = 4$ fragments are generated. 

| length | 16-bit identifier | flgs | fragment offset |
| -----: | ----------------: | ---: | --------------: |
|    700 |               422 |    1 |               0 |
|    700 |               422 |    1 |              85 |
|    700 |               422 |    1 |             170 |
|     60 |               422 |    0 |             255 |

To double check our final result, from the 4 datagrams above, we have a total of $700 \times 3 + 60 = 2160$-byte of data where $680 \times 3 + 40 = 2080$ bytes are the actual data, which confirms with the original requirement.  

###9. Consider the network setup below. Suppose that the ISP instead assigns the router the address 24.34.112.236 and that the network address of the home network is 192.168.1/24.

![p9b image](/Images/p9b.png)

####a. Assign addresses to all interfaces in the home network

Router interface address: `192.168.1.4`
Home addresses: `192.168.1.1`, `192.168.1.2`, `192.168.1.3` 

####b. Suppose each host has two ongoing TCP connections, all to port 80 at host 128.119.41.85. Provide the six corresponding entries in the NAT translation table.


|       WAN side addr |     LAN side addr |
| ------------------: | ----------------: |
| 24.34.112.236, 5001 | 192.168.1.1, 3345 |
| 24.34.112.236, 5002 | 192.168.1.1, 3346 |  
| 24.34.112.236, 5003 | 192.168.1.2, 3345 |
| 24.34.112.236, 5004 | 192.168.1.2, 3346 | 
| 24.34.112.236, 5005 | 192.168.1.3, 3345 |
| 24.34.112.236, 5006 | 192.168.1.3, 3346 | 


###10. What is the difference between a forward table in the destination-based forwarding routers and OpenFlowâ€™s flow table that we discussed in Section 4.4?

- **destination-based forwarding table**
  - forward based only on destination IP address 
  - each entry contains only a set of destination IP address ranges and a set of corresponding link interface that represents where the datagram will be forwarded to 
- **OpenFlow flow table**
  - generalized forwarding 
    - forward based on any set of header field values
    - determined not only by the destination IP address, but also by the source IP address as well as IP prot, TCP source port, TCP destination port, etc. 
  - each entry contains 
    1. Rule: a set of header field values representing how the incoming packets should be matched
    2. Action: a set of actions to be taken when a packet matches the rule of a flow table entry 
    3. Stats: a set of counters that are updated as packets are matched to flow table entries
